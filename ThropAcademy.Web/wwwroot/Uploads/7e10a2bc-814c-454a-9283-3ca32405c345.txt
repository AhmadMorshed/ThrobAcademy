 If you cry, people say you're too sensitive. If you smile, your life is perfect. If you make mistakes, people judge you. If you help others, people take your help for granted. If you love deeply, you're vulnerable. If you forgive, people think you're too easy. If you are kind, you're weak. If you stand up for yourself, people think you're aggressive. If you succeed early, you're lucky. If you fail, people think you didn't try. Hard enough. No matter what you do, people will always have opinions. So, live your truth and be proud of who you are. If it's not a video, you can get free time.
